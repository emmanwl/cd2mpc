# The standard output pattern layout is used to format each logger

# - L (the logger level)
# - D (the logging timestamp "y-m-d hour(24):min:sec")
# - F (the file where the logging event occurred)
# - H (the hostname)
# - M (the message)
# - P (the pid of the current process)
# - % (the literal percent sign '%')
